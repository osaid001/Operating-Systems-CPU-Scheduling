# Operating-Systems-CPU-Scheduling
An implementation of various CPU scheduling algorithms in an operating system context using C++

Overview:
This project provides an implementation of various CPU scheduling algorithms and deadlock management techniques using C++. It also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) created with Visual Studio to visualize and interact with the scheduling processes. The project aims to help users understand the concepts of CPU scheduling and deadlock handling in operating systems through practical code examples and an interactive interface.

Features
CPU Scheduling Algorithms:

First-Come, First-Served (FCFS): Simple scheduling algorithm where the process that arrives first gets executed first.
Shortest Job Next (SJN): Selects the process with the smallest execution time.
Priority Scheduling: Assigns priority to each process, and the process with the highest priority gets executed first.
Round Robin (RR): Processes are assigned a fixed time in a cyclic order, ensuring fair CPU allocation.
Multilevel Queue Scheduling: Segregates the processes into different queues based on priority and uses different scheduling algorithms for each queue.

Deadlock Management:

Techniques to detect, prevent, and avoid deadlocks in the system.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):

Interactive interface to visualize the scheduling and deadlock management processes.
Built using Visual Studio for a seamless user experience.

Technologies Used
C++: The primary programming language used for implementing the scheduling algorithms and deadlock management.
Visual Studio: IDE used for developing the GUI and integrating the project components.
